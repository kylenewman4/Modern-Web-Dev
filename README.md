# Feature 6: Meme Word Games by Owen Grimaldi (ogrimald@nd.edu) and Kyle Newman (knewman2@nd.edu)

### Setup
To setup this demo, simply download the latest release and navigate to the "feature6-ogrimald-knewman2" Vite project folder.
Enter the following command to run the project, using localhost and port 5173 by default:

```
npm run dev
```

Once loaded, you are prompted to either register or login. Once authenticated, you can navigate around the application using the Header navbar.
Currently, there is a home page, as well as memes, crossword, hangman, and the global leaderboard. The memes page allows users to view and add entries to our back4app database, while the games pages allow you to play and submit games to the database, which are displayed on the leaderboard page.
